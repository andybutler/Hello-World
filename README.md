# Hello-World
Here to see firmware for the Befaco Muxlicer.
With any luck, will end up programming Atmega...the coding part is my comfort zone...not messing with repositories, compilers
...not familiar with GitHub as yet...this looks like a very odd rendition of Hello World...
...I'd expect that to be a program which displays the text "Hello World"
